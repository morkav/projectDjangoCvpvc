# projectDjangoCvpvc

## Intro

This project serves two purposes.

The first one is a blog for me and my dear love.
It is fairly simple one and was created to put pictures and news form our stay in Chile.

The second one is my personnal sandbox.
I ll put there my little test (e.g. a [little url shortener](http://cvpvc.fr/m/ "URL Shortener") project with a very simple crawler... )

The site is up and running at cvpvc.fr. Feel free to go and check.

## Deployement
